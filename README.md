A Phaser 3 Project Template
>>>>>>> 73e3a4f (Updated readme.)

Welcome to the Phaser 3 project template using Webpack for efficient asset bundling! Perfect for developers looking to create interactive games with hot-reloading support for a swift development cycle and scripts for building production-ready projects.

<<<<<<< HEAD
What's Inside? 🎮

- [Phaser 3.80.1](https://github.com/phaserjs/phaser): Cutting-edge game development framework.
- [Webpack 5.90.3](https://github.com/webpack/webpack): Robust module bundler with extensive plugins and loaders.

## Getting Started 🌟

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed to manage dependencies and execute scripts via npm.

## Available Commands

| Command         | Description                                    |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`   | Install project dependencies                   |
| `npm run dev`   | Launch a development web server                |
| `npm run build` | Create a production build in the `dist` folder |

## Development Setup 🛠️

1. Clone the repo.
2. Run npm install.
3. Start the development server using npm run dev.

Edit files in src; Webpack will handle the rest, refreshing your browser automatically.

## Project Structure 📁

- `index.html`: The container for your game.
- `src`: Game source code.
- `src/main.js` - The main entry point. This contains the game configuration and starts the game.
- `src/scenes/` - The Phaser Scenes are in this folder.
- `public/assets`: Static assets like images and audio files.

## Asset Management 🎨

Webpack facilitates asset management through module `import` or direct loading from the `public/assets directory`.

## Going Live 🚀

When you issue the `npm run build` command, all static assets are automatically copied to the `dist/assets` folder.

## Customizing Your Setup 🔧

Tweak the Babel settings in `.babelrc` for broader JavaScript support or adjust the Webpack configurations in `webpack/config.js` for more complex changes.
